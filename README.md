# discord-notification-bot
It's pretty simple. Fill in the config file with:
- Your discord bot token
- A name of a site to use from your `praw.ini` file
- Fill in the rest of the config. I forget what they are.

Run the file. Previously, there was a problem where the process couldn't be killed. It's now fixed.
